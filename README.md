# Login-Signup

Login/Signup Project

This project comprises a simple login and signup system with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below is a breakdown of the files and their functionalities:

Files:
style.css: This file contains the styling for the login and signup forms. It imports the Roboto font from Google Fonts and defines the appearance of various elements such as the login card, input fields, buttons, etc.

login.js: JavaScript file responsible for validating user credentials during login. It checks if the entered username and password match any predefined values and redirects the user accordingly.

newuser.js: This JavaScript file handles the registration process. It prompts the user to enter a code provided by the administrator.

forgot1.js and forgot2.js: These JavaScript files manage the process of recovering a forgotten password. forgot1.js handles step 1, where the user inputs their username, and forgot2.js handles step 2, where the user inputs their name to retrieve their password.

HTML Pages:
index.html: This is the main login page where users input their username and password to log in. It includes links to register and recover a forgotten password.

register.html: The registration page where users input a code provided by the administrator.

forgot-password.html: This page assists users who have forgotten their password. It guides them through the process of recovering their password in two steps.

find-account.html: This page is a part of the password recovery process. It prompts the user to input their name to find their account and retrieve their password.

Usage:
To use the system:

Visit the main login page (index.html).
Enter your username and password.
If you're a new user, go to the registration page (register.html) and enter the provided code.
If you've forgotten your password, visit the forgot password page (forgot-password.html) and follow the steps.
